                   I did not say anything about them to anyone I know for two reasons: the first, if I told anyone he would say that I am mad, and the second, they would be in danger if I told anyone about them as all of people would want to see them and might kill them or make them as lab rats. After a week I visited them again to know more about them, their history, the past of them, their religion and why did they in the jungle not with us in houses. My mind was very busy with questions and when I arrived I knocked the wooden door of their shelter and the man opened to me. I entered and sat down and they gave me a strange juice it's taste was good I drank the juice and asked the man about their history he said: "we are the robots which people sent from the earth to Adeo from about 60 years to discover it  ... but there was a red insect which entered our body and changed us to living creatures with blood and brain". Then, I asked him about his age, he said that he does not know it because he was a robot without brain to know anything but they might have 59 or 60 years on Adeo. At last, I asked him about the reason for living in a shelter. He said that they didn't live in a shelter but in a cave and its door is in the shelter to be safe and there is a secret tunnel under the ground with a strong door. When he said that I thanked him and I started to stand up but I felt dizzy...… 
                   What happened? What is that? Where am I? Strange dark place, I can't see anything. Is there anyone here?   I heard a strange voice, he said: “shut up your mouth or I will hurt you ". I asked him: " who are you? Where am I ?" , he said: " I said SHUT UP YOUR MOUTH  but if you want to know I will tell you , I am your conscience or you can say that I am your soul ".  " What do you want from me?". He said: "you must tell people about the shelter of the silver man and his family as they are very serious risk. So, you must be ready for any bad thing from them, from now they are your enemies ... ”.

                I wake up; I was on the same chair that I drank the juice on. I had to decide what I would do... Will I tell my father about that strange family? Will I escape from that case? Will I tell the man that I must tell my father? Will I trust my soul? I am tired I can't think, I can't stand up, I tried and tried many times to stand up but without any feasibility. I thought and decided to tell my father but I would not make him attack them, we would make defenses only. I took my decision and went to my father and I told him everything about them. I will not tell you what he made with me when he knew them. He made me in the palace with him. However, he started to make a strong army, which was the first army on Adeo and ordered them to be ready for anything but he did not tell them who the enemy was or anything about them. So, the soldiers were very cautious. My father asked me to visit the silver family as I don’t know anything about their bad plan, I visited them and played with them and taught them many things that they did not know. The days passed very quickly and one day while I was sleeping I heard sound like a bomb, I was afraid and ran to see what happened …..…*.
