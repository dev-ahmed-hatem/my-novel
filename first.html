            <p>
                In year 2387, Palestine came back to the Muslims and there was an enormous war between The USA and The European Union with the help of Egypt which ended with the victory for The European Union. After 13 years from that, the sky became dark, no sun, no plants and no animals. The earth was damaged by an enormous tornado and the pollution. For the good luck, scientists knew that would happen from about 7 years before the damage and they found a new planet like the earth it called Adeo, which was a small planet with the same weather of the earth. Scientists ordered all people to quit the earth and go to live on Adeo to be safe. But, the earth was damaged before all people go to Adeo, about 3 billions of people was killed on the earth when it damaged. Now, I live on Adeo with my family and friends. People now are about 50 billions person. People learned from the dark past as they were the main reason for the damage of the earth. The pollution that they made by factories and cars damaged the earth and caused the tornado in the ocean and destroyed the land so, there is no place to live no land and no life.

                After that, we shouldn't forget what happened on the earth as we don't have any another planet to live on. So, we should be careful as there is no room for mistakes. After settling down on Adeo scientists decided that they will do their best to keep people safe. So, they said that there won't be factories or cars which work with oil but only by electric energy and solar power and who burn paper or pollute the environment will be punished and the president will send him to the prison. So, the planet is safe and clean and all people live on it without diseases or starvation as farmers use the old kinds of farming tools and without any pesticide or insecticide to keep the soil safe and to save people from any new diseases.  When we were in 3050, there were many new things that weren't on the earth, people brought seeds from the earth and they planted it.        Now, people don't eat anything except vegetables and fruits. There are cars and factories work with electric only, there is no countries, there is one place, one president and there is no wars or soldiers. There are prisons, police and judge to punish anyone makes any mistake, and there are many sky scrapers to live in. My home is in 21 dime street it isn't large but it is good to live in; there are no large houses as the planet is small.

                My name is Tack and I am 32 years old, I will tell you about Adeo and the life on it. The president is called clef, he is a strong, brave and honest man. Jacky, his advisor, who was his old friend. Dina, his servant. And I am the son of the president but I live in a house far from the palace to be free and now I will start the story. I decided to go to the jungle, when I arrived there I saw a strange thing I saw it runs very fast it was thin and tall, I saw its shelter. so, I entered it and saw him, he was a strange person, he wasn't a human or an animal, he was speaking to me but I didn't understand him it was a strange language. I can speak in Arabic, French, German and English, which is my mother tongue. However, he could not speak anyone of them but only a strange language, I sat down and tried to understand. I found his family around me and they were strange People, I can say that they were the native citizens of Adeo and I called their language Adeus. I started to learn their language and after a year, I was good in that language. I understood that they were the native citizens of Adeo. After that, he became my friend, I promised him not to tell anyone about them, and I went back homeâ€¦

                I was excited when I came back to my home and I sat down on a chair and started to think, who are these people? How are they the native citizens of Adeo and what happened when we came here? They were strange people with a round silver face, black eyes, small mouth, tall and thin body. They may have the same body of my robot but they have blood and brain but on the other hand my robot is a machine without feelings or brain, but only the same body of them.
