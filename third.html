                I heard a strange sound like the sound of bomb, I went very fast with fear to my father and asked him about what happened and he said " it is the sign of war with silver man's kind". I was surprised when I saw a strong army on Adeo our army and the enemy's army. Two strong armies!! What is that? It was the first time for me to see a war, I was born in 3020 it was the first war I see but what will I do? It was a war between two armies. Who will win? The war started and enemy's soldiers were stronger from us and we saw that there is no way to escape from the war we don't have any another place to live. That was  the most danger war for people, it is live or death war. The two armies clashed and the war continued for 6 hours at the end we won and conquered them but we lost lots of soldiers in that war as well we will not see them anymore again. There will not be silver man or his type. I am sad and happy in the same time, I am sad as I don't have friends now but I am happy as we will be safe without enemies. I went to the shelter and entered the cave with two soldiers and when I entered, the door was closed. we became frightened from that. But I started to walk in it until I reached the end of the tunnel. There was a thin air I couldn't take my breath well. I ran to reach the door and when I reached it, I found it closed and  tried to open it. Finally I opened it and found a great place which was a green garden with a golden palace,  golden seats, tables and lots of jewelries. I entered and saw everything there and planned to make it my golden palace. I decided to buy everything I want and buy servants and guards and make my own country but I remembered that money will be finished one day and I need love to have the two Important things in life; money and love. Then, I planned to get married. I remembered that I don’t know a polite beautiful girl to get married.  I asked my father to find a polite girl for me and told him that I have my palace, money, guards and I want to make a family. About two weeks passed like a day and my father sent me a message I opened it and I found that it says: '' my dear, I found a polite girl for you , she is 25 years old and her name is Maria , come to me when you read the message as I want to speak with you.. " .

                I was very happy to know that and I wore my coat and went to my father's palace. "My son, I know that you are happy but you should know that I am ill and I might be died in any time. So, I will tell you something to find happiness, don’t make your wife sad and don’t ask her what she can't do, if you do it, you will be happy with your wife.."  "ok, dad I want to know everything about her, please" "my son, I will tell you about her, she is 25 years old and her name is Maria, she is polite and beautiful girl, her father is a doctor and he was born in Russia…"  "Great dad, I want to see that girl" "ok, I will speak with her father for you and I will tell you when I find a new thing" "thank you dad.." . I went to my palace and remembered the silver man and what happened for him and remembered the new door which I made for the palace instead of the door which was at the end of the tunnel. After a week I went to my father to see him, when I arrived I saw my father in a bad situation, he was very ill, I entered his room and sat down in front of his bed "how are you dad?" "I don’t know if I will live more but you must be the president from now" "no, dad what about my brother? He is older than me and he must be.." "Please, Tack do what I say, you are more wise than him and you will be a brave, clever president" "ok, dad" "Maria's father will be here soon. So, meet him and speak with him about his daughter" "ok, dad, don’t tire yourself" "Now, go and prepare yourself and wait him" "thanks dad …"

            <p>
                I went to prepare myself and waited the man then I heard noise. "Tack, your dad died…" "What? Do you know what you say, Dina?" "yes, sir come here fast, please" I ran, went down stairs and went to the room. He was killed not dead, he ate poisonous food, I called his doctor and the police to know what happened to my father.
                When the police came the detective kina asked all people in the palace and asked the chef who cooked the food, no one was in the place of that crime, no person of the citizens know that the president was killed "sir Tack, no evidence and no one committed that crime, what can I do?" "Nothing until now? What do you do as a detective? My father was killed and you took five hours until now, what did you do in those five hours?" "Sorry sir I was searching for the killer and the poison but no new thing" "Go away from here, useless man…". I didn’t know what should I do, my father died and his will to me was: "Be the president, Tack". I sent to my brother and tell him our father's will and waited until he came to me. "Tack, you know that I am the older brother and I know our father's will as you must be the president but, what about me? Where should I live if you became the president?" "ROBERT, what is your problem? That is my father's will and I will be the president". I left him in the room  and went to see Jacky to know his opinion… "sir Tack, don’t be angry with your brother as he want to be the president because he is the older but he should know that no rook to discuss that thing, you and I can't change your father's will, I think that your father wanted that because you are wise and strict". "Ok Jacky I will try to persuade him as I don’t want a problem with my brother".
